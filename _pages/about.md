 I am a robotics engineer at Sony. Previously I was working as a research scientist with [Marco Gallieri](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=moNjsXoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Jan Koutnik](https://nnaisense.com/company/) at [Nnaisense](https://nnaisense.com/). I obtained a PhD in Robotics from EPFL at [the learning algorithms and system laboratory](http://lasa.epfl.ch/), under the supervision of [Prof. Aude Billard](http://lasa.epfl.ch/people/member.php?SCIPER=115671). During my Phd at LASA, I was a part of [Cogimon](https://cogimon.eu/) and [Alterego](http://www.euromov.eu/alterego/homepage) and later, during my postdoc, I was contributing to [crowdbot](http://crowdbot.eu/). I hold MSc in Mechatronics and BSc in Mechanical engineering from [Amirkabir university of technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en/). I am mainly interested in endowing robotic system with a capability to move very fast while being safe for human-robot interactions.
